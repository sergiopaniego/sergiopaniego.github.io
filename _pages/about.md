I'm a first-year PhD student at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, researching artificial intelligence and robotics.
I obtained an Informatics Engineering and Software Engineering Dual Degree at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos and a 
MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid with a José Cuena award.

The projects I'm working on at the moment can be found openly in my [GitHub account](https://github.com/sergiopaniego).

In addition to research, I also help teaching two courses for third-year students at the same uni related with my research interests. 
More info about it in [teaching section](/teaching). I have also given some [talks](/bio_cv) about my work.

I have participated in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program three years in a row. 
The first one in [2018](https://jderobot.github.io/activities/gsoc/2018) as a Student Intern working with [JdeRobot Robotics and Artificial Intelligence association](https://jderobot.github.io/) and 
the two following as a mentor in two artificial intelligence related projects, [Detection Studio](https://github.com/JdeRobot/DetectionStudio)
 and [Behavior Studio](https://github.com/JdeRobot/BehaviorStudio) with the same association, where I still collaborate.

One is my hobbies that i enjoy the most is [photography](https://www.instagram.com/sergiopaniego/).
