I'm a PhD candidate at [Universidad Rey Juan Carlos](https://www.urjc.es/), Madrid, researching artificial intelligence, computer vision and robotics and its application to autonomous driving.
I obtained an Informatics Engineering and Software Engineering Dual Degree at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos and a 
MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid with a José Cuena award.

The projects I’m working on now can be found in my [GitHub account](https://github.com/sergiopaniego).

In addition to research, I'm also a teaching assistant for some courses (Artificial Intelligence and Robotics) for third-year students at the same uni related to my research interests. 
I have also developed a course for [Platzi](https://platzi.com/) platform called [Object Detection and Segmentation with Tensorflow](https://platzi.com/cursos/tensorflow-objetos/) among others ([teaching section](/teaching)).
I also like to give [talks](/teaching) about my work and artificial intelligence in general.

I have participated in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program six years in a row. 
The first one was in [2018](https://jderobot.github.io/activities/gsoc/2018) as a Student Intern working with [JdeRobot Robotics and Artificial Intelligence association](https://jderobot.github.io/) and 
the following  five as a mentor in several artificial intelligence related projects, [Detection Studio](https://github.com/JdeRobot/DetectionStudio), [Behavior Studio](https://github.com/JdeRobot/BehaviorStudio) and [Deep Learning Studio](https://github.com/JdeRobot/DeepLearningStudio/) with the same association, where I still collaborate. 
These projects and others have led to [publications](/publications).
