I hold a PhD from [Universidad Rey Juan Carlos](https://www.urjc.es/) (Cum Laude), specializing in artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics with a focus on their applications in autonomous driving.
I obtained an Informatics Engineering and Software Engineering Dual Degree at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos and a 
MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid with a JosÃ© Cuena award.

The projects Iâ€™m working on now can be found in my [GitHub account](https://github.com/sergiopaniego).

In addition to my research, I have also served as an AI Educational Consultant, developing and teaching advanced AI courses at universities, companies, and on-demand (see [teaching section](/teaching) for more details). I enjoy giving [talks](/teaching) about my work and the broader field of artificial intelligence. As a Machine Learning Engineer Consultant, I have collaborated with companies to develop and deploy cutting-edge AI technologies such as YOLOv8 and SAM.

I am interested in open source. I have participated in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program seven years in a row. 
The first one was in [2018](https://jderobot.github.io/activities/gsoc/2018) as a Student Intern working with [JdeRobot Robotics and Artificial Intelligence association](https://jderobot.github.io/) and 
the following  six as a mentor in several artificial intelligence related projects, [Detection Studio](https://github.com/JdeRobot/DetectionStudio), [Behavior Studio](https://github.com/JdeRobot/BehaviorStudio) and [Deep Learning Studio](https://github.com/JdeRobot/DeepLearningStudio/) with the same association, where I still collaborate. 
These projects and others have led to [publications](/publications). I am currently admin for this organization working on open-source project. I have participated in other open source projects, specially with **[ðŸ¤— Hugging Face](/open_source_contributions)**.

I am open to research collaborations, teaching courses, talks... [Drop me an email](mailto:sergiopaniegoblanco@gmail.com) to get in touch :)

One of the hobbies that I enjoy the most is [photography](https://www.instagram.com/sergiopaniego/).
